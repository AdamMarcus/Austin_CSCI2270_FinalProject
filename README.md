# Austin_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Team: Adam Austin

For my project I am going to experiment with hash tables. I will create a complicated hash table where each index has a modified hash function  associated with it. When you run something through the hash function, you get the first index, which runs it through the second hash function which gives it a second index. This should hopefully help to spread out the data and help avoid collisions. I want to look some more into how to write good hash functions that sufficiently spread out the indexes.
