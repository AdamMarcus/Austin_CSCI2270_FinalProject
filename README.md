# Austin_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Team: Adam Austin

For my project I am going to experiment with hash tables. I will create a complicated hash table where each index has a modified hash table associated with it. When you run something through the hash table, you get the first index, which runs it through the second hash table which gives it a second index, this should idealy help to spread the data out for easy accesability.
